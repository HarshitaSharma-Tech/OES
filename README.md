# OES
This project is a conceptual UI design and workflow model for an Order Execution System (OES) tailored to broker-dealers trading in the global fixed income markets. The system is designed to handle the full lifecycle of bond trading â€“ from market data visualization to order placement, trade management, and net position tracking.
